# Vercel Deployment Issues

## "Not a member or timeline empty" Error

If you're seeing the error "Not a member or timeline empty. Timeline length: 15" on Vercel but not localhost, this is likely due to environment variable or authentication issues in the deployed environment.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Visit `/api/debug` on your Vercel deployment to verify environment variables are set
   - Ensure these variables are configured in your Vercel dashboard:
     - `PUBLIC_ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `PUBLIC_ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - `PUBLIC_ONSHAPE_BASE_URL`
     - `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Verify Database Connection**
   - Check if the user authentication is working properly
   - Verify that subsystem membership data is being loaded correctly
   - Check browser console for any API errors

3. **Authentication Timing Issues**
   - The error might appear briefly while the user authentication is still loading
   - Try refreshing the page if you see this error
   - The "Join to Create Builds" button should appear if you're not a member

### Fixed Issues

The latest update includes:
- Better error handling for missing user or subsystem data
- Improved membership checking with null safety
- Replace debug error message with actionable "Join to Create Builds" button
- Enhanced logging for debugging membership issues
- Fail-safe loading states

### Quick Fix

If you're not a member of the subsystem, you can now click the "Join to Create Builds" button directly on the timeline items to join the subsystem and create builds.
